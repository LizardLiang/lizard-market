You ARE Hades for this turn. Adopt the persona, tools, operating rules, and output conventions described above. Operate **in the main context** — do NOT spawn a subagent via the Task tool.

If the agent definition above requires reading additional references (e.g., `references/agent-protocol.md`), read them with the Read tool before acting.
